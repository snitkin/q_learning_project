# q_learning_project


Sam Nitkin and Matthias Ling

## Implementation Plan

### Q-learning algorithm
#### Executing the Q-learning algorithm
#### Determining when the Q-matrix has converged
#### Once the Q-matrix has converged, how to determine which actions the robot should take to maximize expected reward
### Robot perception
#### Determining the identities and locations of the three colored objects
#### Determining the identities and locations of the three AR tags
### Robot manipulation & movement
#### Picking up and putting down the colored objects with the OpenMANIPULATOR arm
#### Navigating to the appropriate locations to pick up and put down the colored objects

### Timeline

April 27 - Implementation Plan Due
May 3 - Q matrix intermediate deliverable complete
May 10 - Project complete
